# workspace_one_uem_incomplete

*IMPORTANT*: This code as-is is **NOT WORKING**. I am posting this as a reference so that hopefully others can benefit from it. 

This was written to query the Workspace One UEM (WS1) aka Airwatch APIs using Powershell against a cloud instance of WS1. 

I wrote this as a personal part-time hobby project to help me in a previous engagement. It once worked, but I had to clean it up before posting it here **AFTER** I lost access to that environment. So it has not been tested after those changes, therefore it is very likely broken now. 

It is very incomplete - I wrote these for very specific use cases and never meant to cover the breath of the Workspace One UEM APIs (not even close). 

It is lacking in almost every respect: error checking / handling, structure, still contains a ton of useless notes/comments hence why I am posting this as a reference. 

I would be interested in continuing this work if anyone has access to a WS1 environment that could be used to continue development and turn this into a proper module.
